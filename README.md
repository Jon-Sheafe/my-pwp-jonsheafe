This project is for my pwp of my personal website which will discribe my personal website.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your Purpose. It explains exactly what you want to do with your site. From what I understand, you're going to be using your site as a resume - which is a great idea.
Your Audience section is also done very well. As you develop this site, think about the best way to display your skills. Make sure it's easy to navigate and is very aesthetically pleasing, but also be sure it displays all the needed information that makes you hireable. 
While your Goal is written very well - do not consider freelance as a fallback. Consider freelance as a chance to improve your skills until a job you really want comes along. When developing your site, don't just focus on businesses - make sure single clients also become interested in your services once they see what you can do.


Great job with your Persona. It shows all needed info, makes it clear what your goal is, and is written very well.
Based on your Use Case and Persona, it seems like you understand exactly what you want, and understood this assignment very well. Great job.

Your Directory structure is perfect
Your HTML looks good, although I would suggest using some other tags to improve the look of the front end. (see suggestions below)



### Edits &amp; Suggestions 
- Your HTML is written very well, but instead of using `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` tags - use `<ul>` `<li>` and `<ol>`. Do some research on these. they will make your code much cleaner. ul places the li (list items) in bullets, while `<ol>` places them in numbered bullets.



Overall, you did a great job. You've passed milestone 1 within tier 3! You may now advance to milestone 2a. Keep up the good work.



## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Great job on your wireframes. They're simple, but show exactly what you're trying to create with your final site.

Your home page is very simple and clean, which I like, but I wonder if users would get bored by just seeing a wall of text next to your picture. Think about ways you can make your front page more user friendly. I understand that you're trying to display professionalism and show employers what you know and why you should be hired, but make sure that employer is interested in viewing your website. 

If you have any free time at home or during the class, begin gathering images, content, and any other assets that you will use on the site. This will speed up the final development process and give you more time to style and polish the site before it is published. Also, think about color schemes, fonts, and other styling options you can use to personalize your site. 

For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

One of the guidelines that we have for the personal website is a single page site if multiple pages aren't needed. In your case, I would definitely suggest making your site single page for the content you're trying to show. You can have links for a downloadable resume and other documents that will make you more hireable, but keep the navbar free of page links and just compress the content of your site onto one page. To do this, make your landing section very interesting, and talk about you. Then, go into your experience, and finally, have a contact form at the bottom. Your wireframe shows an interesting contact form - you may have to talk to Rochelle about that. Usually, we use a very basic but very well build contact form that you can easily implement into your code. If you want something more advanced, we'll see if it is within scope.

I would also suggest including social media links to any professional profiles that you have - such as LinkedIn or a professional Twitter account. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.


Great job with your HTML and Directory structure as well - I only noticed one slight mistake, and that was the indentation of your img tag on line 17. No big deal, but watch out for the code appearance.



### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Plan out single page site.
Think about contact form.
Think about other extra content or changes that I suggested above.



##Really nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
