This project is for my pwp of my personal website which will discribe my personal website.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great job on your Purpose. It explains exactly what you want to do with your site. From what I understand, you're going to be using your site as a resume - which is a great idea.
Your Audience section is also done very well. As you develop this site, think about the best way to display your skills. Make sure it's easy to navigate and is very aesthetically pleasing, but also be sure it displays all the needed information that makes you hireable. 
While your Goal is written very well - do not consider freelance as a fallback. Consider freelance as a chance to improve your skills until a job you really want comes along. When developing your site, don't just focus on businesses - make sure single clients also become interested in your services once they see what you can do.


Great job with your Persona. It shows all needed info, makes it clear what your goal is, and is written very well.
Based on your Use Case and Persona, it seems like you understand exactly what you want, and understood this assignment very well. Great job.

Your Directory structure is perfect
Your HTML looks good, although I would suggest using some other tags to improve the look of the front end. (see suggestions below)



### Edits &amp; Suggestions 
- Your HTML is written very well, but instead of using <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> tags - use <ul> <li> and <ol>. Do some research on these. they will make your code much cleaner. ul places the li (list items) in bullets, while <ol> places them in numbered bullets.



Overall, you did a great job. You've passed milestone 1 within tier 3! You may now advance to milestone 2a. Keep up the good work.
